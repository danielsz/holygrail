* Holy grail

** What is it?

This demonstrates the *holy grail* workflow for web development the way I envision it: an auto-restartable back-end in the REPL + a hot-reloadable front-end in the browser.

This workflow is built on top of [[http://boot-clj.com/][Boot]], a build tool, and [[https://github.com/danielsz/system/tree/master/examples/boot][system]], a component library.  

** Installation
Clone this repo, cd into it and start the development pipeline build.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git clone git@github.com:danielsz/holygrail.git
$ cd holygrail
$ boot dev
#+END_SRC

** Principle of operation
Compose a build pipeline: 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(deftask dev
  "Run a restartable system in the Repl"
  []
  (comp
   (environ :env {:http-port 3000})
   (watch)
   (system :sys #'dev-system :auto true :files ["handler.clj"])
   (reload)
   (cljs)
   (repl :server true)))
#+END_SRC

Start it: 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ boot dev
#+END_SRC

The REPL advertises its coordinates.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
nREPL server started on port 49722 on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl://127.0.0.1:49722
#+END_SRC

Launch your favorite editor, and connect to the headless REPL (~M-x cider-connect~ in Emacs works great). 

Your web app is started and listening at [[http://localhost:3000]].

The ~auto~ option in the ~system~ boot task takes care of your application lifecycle. Your system will automatically be reset after editing ~handler.clj~. Changes elsewhere that do not require a system restart will be reloaded on the fly everytime you save your work. 

*Note:* The ~build.boot~ in this repo already contains those options.
